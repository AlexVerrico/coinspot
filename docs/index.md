# Coinspot API Wrapper in Python
### Documentation is a work in progress - if there's something that you think is missing, please open an issue and let me know: [https://github.com/AlexVerrico/coinspot/issues/new](https://github.com/AlexVerrico/coinspot/issues/new)

This documentation is not designed to replace the Coinspot docs, but rather to show you how each of the raw API functions can be accessed through this library.  
As such, I suggest that you read the [Coinspot API Docs](https://www.coinspot.com.au/v2/api) first.

## Installation
```shell
pip install coinspot
```

## Setup
To use parts of this library, you may need an API Token. You can obtain one by following the official Coinspot instructions at the top of [this page](https://www.coinspot.com.au/v2/api)

## Usage
Start here: [API V2 General Concepts](api/v2/general_concepts.md)
